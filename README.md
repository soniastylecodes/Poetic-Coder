### Hi, I'm Sonia Atsen 👋  Popularly known as **SoniaStyle**

I’m an software developer, writer (Poet) and public speaker. I'm the teamlead of [Jos Tech Girls](jostechgirls.com). I am an avid advocate for diversity and intersectionality in technology and accessibility in web development. I am also a storyteller, so for me, its not about the number of codes i have written, but the way i can prefectly tell my story. 

- 📱  I’m currently working on a site to teach kids how to code using poetry.. Yeah, it gonna be real fun
- 🤓 I’m currently learning WORDPRESS.

- 🚴🏽‍♀️  Fun fact: I am slightly obsessed with dogs and can usually be found with my laptop, coding or watching slice-of-life anime.
- 😄 Favourite Quote: If you can shave your brows and drw new once, then you must be in TECH 😄😄😄
