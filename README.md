## Hi, I'm Sonia Atsen 👋  Popularly known as **SoniaStyle** 

I’m a software developer, writer (Poet) and public speaker. I'm the teamlead of [Jos Tech Girls](jostechgirls.com). I am an avid advocate for diversity and intersectionality in technology and accessibility in web development. I am also a storyteller, so for me, its not about the number of codes i have written, but the way i can prefectly tell my stories.

- 📱 I’m currently working on a site to teach kids how to code using poetry.
- 🤓 I’m currently learning WORDPRESS.
- 💬  Ask me about WEB DEVELOPMENT especially Frontend development.
- While i current started learning about Stocks, Cryptocurrency and would look into blockcain technology in 2022 or so
- My stacks are Node.js, Mongo DB, React.js + Html and CSS.

- 😄 Favourite Quote: If you can shave your brows and draw new once, then you must be in TECH 😄😄� 
- I love Tesla Cars and i hope that very soon, i afford one 😄

Finally i hope i can inspire you to be the best version of yourself and be of greater value to your society.
I hope to do better and create the tech world i want to see..
