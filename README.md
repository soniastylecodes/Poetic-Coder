## Hi, I'm Sonia Atsen 👋  Popularly known as **SoniaStyle** 

I’m a software developer, writer (Poet) and public speaker. I'm the teamlead of [Jos Tech Girls](jostechgirls.com). I am an avid advocate for diversity and intersectionality in technology and accessibility in web development. I am also a storyteller, so for me, its not about the number of codes i have written, but the way i can prefectly tell my stories.

- 🤓 I’m currently learning BLOCKCHAIN DEVELOPMENT.
- 💬  Ask me about WEB DEVELOPMENT especially Frontend development.
- While i current started learning about Stocks, Cryptocurrency and would look into blockcain technology in 2022 or so
